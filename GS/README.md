A list of METASPACE URLs for the public datasets selected for the gold standard is available [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/metaspace2020/coloc/blob/master/GS/dataset_urls.txt).

The ion images are available under `gs_imgs1` and `gs_imgs2` file names. To join both files into one arhive run `cat gs_imgs* > gs_imgs.tar.gz`

The initial expert rankings can be found in `rankings.csv`, the filtered gold standard with average rankings is in `coloc_gs.csv`.
